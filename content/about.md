  <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Pirikli</strong> — a Python learner and builder focused on text processing and natural language workflows.</p>
</div>

I’m currently building practical Python skills to work with text as data — parsing, cleaning, structuring, and exploring how language can be processed and understood by code. My goal is to become a reliable developer who can deliver useful tools and solutions that help make messy text more accessible, analyzable, and actionable.

## Who I Am

I come from a background in language and storytelling, and over time I’ve shifted my focus toward the engineering side of text — how it can be shaped, analyzed, and automated using Python.

This site is my public record of growth: what I’m learning, the projects I’m building, and the tools I’m mastering along the way. I share what I discover as I go, with transparency and real-world examples.

I am committed to learning in public and creating a visible, evidence-based portfolio that reflects **what I can actually do** with code — not just what I’ve studied.

## What I’m Working On

I am actively building skills in:

- **Python Fundamentals:** Core syntax, data types, control structures, file I/O, functions
- **Text Processing:** Regex, string manipulation, structured text extraction
- **Practical Tooling:** Writing scripts that solve real reuse problems with text
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for project history, collaboration, and visibility
- **Documentation:** Clear README files, examples, and usage instructions

I am also exploring foundational NLP concepts and tooling, and I’m beginning to experiment with libraries such as **spaCy** and **Hugging Face Transformers** as part of my ongoing learning.

## What You’ll Find Here

This website reflects my journey and learning process:

- **Projects:** Practical repositories with runnable tools and scripts — the artifacts that show what I’ve accomplished.
- **Learning Log:** Short posts and reflections that document what I’ve learned, how I solved specific problems, and what challenges I encountered.
- **About:** A clear summary of who I am, what I can do today, and what I’m working toward.

Every piece here is focused on building real, demonstrable technical capability.

## My Approach

I believe in **visible progress**. That means:

- Every project I publish includes a clear description of the problem it solves.
- Each post shares not just results, but how I arrived at them.
- I build things that someone else can run, reuse, or learn from.

This approach isn’t about perfection. It’s about **practical growth and visible skill development**.
