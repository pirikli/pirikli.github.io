👋 Hi, I’m **[Pirikli](https://pirikli.substack.com/)**—a multilingual poet, storyteller, and AI-augmented creative writer.

I grew up in **Pirik**, a small South Azerbaijani village where my love for stories began with my parents’ oral tales. That childhood spark carried me through university, poetry, blogging, and—after a detour into the corporate world—back to my true path: storytelling.

- **Corporate Years** → Learned discipline, languages, and technology while searching for a meaningful career.
    
- **Awakening** → Realized that **writing + AI + languages** is my future-proof path.
    
- **Commitment** → Today, I explore **AI-assisted storytelling, interactive fiction, poetic narratives, and digital publishing** while learning in public.
