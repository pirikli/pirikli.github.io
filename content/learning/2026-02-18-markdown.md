## A remarkable story of Markdown!

As a poet and a Windows user, I’ve long lived inside the world of Microsoft Office Word. It was fine. I was content.

But when I decided to add another P to my name and become “Pirikl, a Poet and Pythonista,” Word began to feel ineffective. It had turned into a cemetery for my notes. I was burying them once and for all—never returning to refer to or review them.

So I started exploring other tools—Notion, Evernote, and others. Yet I found myself struggling with their interfaces and layered features. They were time-consuming. What I wanted was simple: a distraction-free, efficient space where I could write down course notes quickly and clearly.

During one of those courses, I stumbled upon what would become a lifetime ally. I was taking a course on Git when I became acquainted with the README file. I decided to write a clean README for my newly created GitHub repository. It was clean. It was elegant. Its syntax was simple and effective.

That was when I realized I had been writing in Markdown. I paused the course and began exploring the world of Markdown.


## Here is what I discovered about Markdown:**

For me, Markdown is a primitive markup language that, with its simple tools (#, *, !, =, -, ~), makes your life easy and fluent. I've always been jealous of life in primitive times—a simple and intentional life without the complications of today's world. In the coding world, Markdown allows me to live such a simple and effective life. It allows me to document rapidly and deeply without engaging in the decorative syntax of HTML or CSS.
I learn, I document, and I go.

## The followings are the features Markdown that I use daily

### 1. Headers

```md
	# First Level Header
	## Second Level Header
	### Third Level Header
	#### Fourth Level Header
	##### Fifth Level Header
	###### Sixth Level Header
```

***Alternate Syntax*** for `H1` & `H2`: Use a horizontal line (🟰 & ➖) under the heading text.

```md
	First Level Header
	==================

	Second Level Header
	-------------------
```

_**Note:**_
> 
 > Initially, I was using headers in the wrong way. I was using them everywhere on the page without any order. Then I recognized that headers are meant to create hierarchy, not style. They are not decorative elements. They exist to establish structure. That is why they are ordinal. I realized that on a single page, you should use only one H1 heading.


### 2. Text formatting

| Format              | Syntax                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Bold**            | `**text**` or `__text__`     |
| _Italic_            | `*text*` or `_text_          |
| _**Bold & Italic**_ | `***text***` or `___text___` |
| ~~Strikethrough~~   | `~~text~~`                   |
| Highlighted         | `==Highlight==`              |   


### 3. Paragraphs & Line Breaks 

Use 2️⃣<code>SPACE</code>s(☄️☄️) at the end of a line to insert a line break.
Press <code>ENTER</code> to start a new paragraph.

```md
This is the first line.☄️☄️ 
This is the second line.☄️☄️

This is a new paragraph.☄️☄️
```

### 4. Blockquote

#### ❇️Blockquotes are created using the `>` symbol.

```md
> This is a blockquote.
>
> - You can include multiple lines.
> - Even lists inside!
```

#### ❇️Nested Blockquotes:
```md
> This is an outer blockquote.
>> This is an inner blockquote.
>>> You can go deeper.
```

### 5.Horizontal Lines

Use three or more asterisks `***`, dashes `---`, or underscores `_ _ _`:
I usually use these lines to separate header blocks at the same level, for example, to separate all second-level headers (H2) on a page.


### 6.Code Blocks

#### 💠Inline code
✅ To make codes visible as it is, we wrap it in 2️⃣ backticks `` ` ` `` 

#### 💠Code Blocks

✅ To create code blocks, use three backticks (```) or tildes (~~~) before and after the code snippet, and provide the language name after the initial backticks in order to highlight the code syntax.

```
   ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```
```


### 7.🔗Links:

#### 🖇️Inline link:

```md
[**My GitHub**](https://github.com/pirikli "Pirikli, a Poet & Pythonista")
```

#### 🖇️Reference link:
```md
[My Linkedin] [ refrence-to-link ]

[ refrence-to-link ]: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pirikli/ "Pirikli"
```


#### 🖇️Direct Link:

```md
<pirikliartan@gmail.com>
```


### 8. 🖼️Images:

#### 📷Inline Image:

```md
![Alt text](image-url.jpg "Image Title")
```

#### 📷Reference Image:
```md
![Alt text][image]
    
[image]: image-url.jpg "Image Title"
```


### 9. 📃Lists

#### 🔢Ordered list

```md
1. This is the first item of this ordered list.
2. This is the second item.
3. The third item.
```

#### ⏹️Unordered list:

```md
* This is the first item of this unordered list.  
* This is the second one.
* and son on...
```


#### 🪺Nested lists(indentation in lists):
✅Use `TAB` to indent nested lists
```
1. The first item with inner list:
    - first inner
    - second inner
2. The second item with nested list
    * first inner
    * second inner
        - one
        - two
            * A
            * B
```

#### Task Lists:  

```md
- [ ] Wake Up
- [ ] Get Up
- [ ] Wash Up
- [ ] Rush Up
```


### 10. Scaping Characters:
To display Markdown symbols as plain text, use a backslash (`\`).

```markdown
\*This text is not italicized, because I scaped the asterisk.\*
```
 
### 11. Tables

```md
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |
```


### 12. Heading IDs

I think of it as an "Inner Link" or "In-Page Link."
I usually use it to create a "Table of Contents" and a "🦘 Jump Up High" link.   
  
```md

[Here is the Link to that Heading](#headid5)   👈🏻we click here

# This is a heading we want to refer or link to {#headid5} 👈🏻we jump here
```

 

### 13. Footnotes 
```md
This is a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote text.

```


### 14. Best Markdown Editors:
There is nothing called BEST; you will find a suitable Markdown editor based on your needs.
I use Obsidian as my note-taking and knowledge system, while using VSCode extensions for editing Markdown.


## Conclustion:
I've always said, "Simplicity is power." Even in house decoration, I prefer the color white because it can adapt to any future tweak. This is true about Markdown. You have your organized notes that can easily evolve into other forms later. With Markdown, you are writing on stone, not on sand. Your notes are organised in simple and effective syntax. they are preserved in your `.md` files and later can evolove into other formats when needed.
