## Context

For years I lived inside Microsoft Word. It worked — but my notes were buried and rarely revisited.

When I began learning Git and creating repositories, I wrote my first proper README file. That was when I realized I had been writing in Markdown.

I paused the course and explored Markdown further. This note documents what I understood and what I actually use daily.

## Core Concepts Covered

- Structural hierarchy with headers  
- Essential formatting tools  
- Writing clean documentation with code blocks  
- Organizing content using lists, tables, and links  
- Keeping notes portable and simple  

---

## 🔹 Concept 1: Headers Create Structure

### What I Understood

Headers are not decorative.  
They create hierarchy.

Initially, I used headers randomly across a page. Later I realized they exist to establish structure. On a single page, there should only be one `H1`, and the rest should follow logical order.

### Minimal Example

```md
# H1
## H2
### H3
```
Alternate syntax for H1 and H2:
```md
Heading 1
=========

Heading 2
---------
```
### Why This Matters in My Workflow

When writing long learning notes, structure determines readability.
Proper header use makes navigation easier — especially inside GitHub and Obsidian.

## 🔹 Concept 2: Essential Text Formatting

### What I Understood

Markdown provides simple formatting tools without the complexity of rich text editors.

The formatting I actually use daily:

> Bold for emphasis
>
> Italic for nuance
>
> Strikethrough for revisions
>
> Inline code for commands and syntax

### Minimal Example
```md
**Bold**
*Italic*
~~Strikethrough~~
`inline code`
==Highlight==
```

### Why This Matters in My Workflow

Formatting helps highlight important parts of technical notes without slowing me down.

## 🔹 Concept 3: Code Blocks for Documentation

### What I Understood

`Code` should be visually separated from explanation.
Markdown makes this simple using triple backticks.

### Minimal Example

````
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
````

### Why This Matters in My Workflow

Since I am learning Python, clean code blocks allow me to document scripts clearly and revisit them later without confusion. I must admit that I simply enjoy seeing colorflul code blocks in Markdown!


## 🔹 Concept 4: Lists and Organization

### What I Understood

Lists are essential for breaking down steps and concepts.

Ordered lists are useful for sequences.
Unordered lists help summarize ideas.

### Minimal Example

```md
# ordered lists
1. First step
2. Second step

# on-ordered lists
- Item A
- Item B

# Task lists:
- [ ] Review notes
- [ ] Practice code
```

### Why This Matters in My Workflow

Most of my learning notes are step-based. Lists make the structure clearer and easier to review.

## 🔹 Concept 5: Links, Images, and Tables

### What I Understood

Markdown allows documentation to remain simple while still supporting:

Links, Images, Tables, Footnotes, Internal anchor links

### Minimal Example
```md
# an example of link
[My GitHub](https://github.com/pirikli "text over")

# an simple table

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data A   | Data B   |
```

### Why This Matters in My Workflow

This makes Markdown suitable not only for personal notes but also for GitHub repositories and structured documentation.


## Tools I Use

I use:

Obsidian for note-taking

VSCode for editing Markdown inside projects

There is no “best” editor — only what fits your workflow.

## What Changed in My Understanding

I stopped using heavy editors for technical notes.

I began prioritizing structure over decoration.

I realized simplicity improves speed.

I now prefer plain `.md` files because they are portable and future-proof.

## Next Step

Next, I want to use Markdown more intentionally inside my Python and Git projects — especially for documenting small scripts.
