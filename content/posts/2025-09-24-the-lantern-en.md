## The Lantern🏮
Every book has stories that stir, and stories that shine.  
My **Lantern** is not just shining a path — it *is* the path: **the path of love**.  
It won **second place** at the *Kitabyurdu Literary Competition* and was later published alongside other selected stories and poems inside **Towards the Light**.

**The Lantern** is not merely about the flame of a lamp —  
it is the story of a mother’s undying light.  

Even when the lantern’s flame dies, the love, hope, and faith inside a human heart keep burning.  
Darkness and storms may rage, but they falter before the inner glow.

## 📚 About the Book

**Towards the Light** is not just a book —  
it’s a **map of voices**, gathering writers and poets who call readers from shadow to light, from sorrow to hope, from loneliness to shared living.  

My story stands among these works as one more note in the great chorus of *light seekers*.

## 🏅 Honor & Meaning

For me, these printed pages are not just ink and words.  
They carry the footprints of my journey as a writer.  

The recognition of **The Lantern** is not only personal;  
it is a small tribute to the living fire of our language and literature, still burning despite every attempt to extinguish it.
